With over 6 years of experience designing and delivering scalable, secure, and user-focused mobile applications, I specialize in building robust, maintainable, and testable architectures leveraging Kotlin, Modular Architecture, Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, Flow, Dagger Hilt, Koin, Gradle, and Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP). I use tools like Detekt and MockK to ensure code quality and reliability.

I have contributed to key fintech domains such as FAST payments, Open Banking, QR transactions, international transfers, and KYC processes ‚Äî delivering scalable and secure solutions impacting millions of users.

My expertise includes advanced mobile technologies such as OCR, NFC, face and object detection with ML Kit, and Mobile Device Management (MDM) using Android DevicePolicy API. I am proficient in iOS development with Swift and SwiftUI, employing design patterns like VIPER, MVC, and MVVM to create seamless cross-platform experiences.

I apply Clean Architecture, MVVM, and SOLID principles to produce maintainable and high-performance codebases. Security is a top priority; I implement advanced measures including root detection, Proguard/Dexguard obfuscation, and anti-hooking techniques to safeguard applications.

Leveraging Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), I share business logic across Android and iOS, enhancing development efficiency without compromising quality.

Additionally, I develop applications for Android Auto, enhancing the in-car user experience by integrating navigation, media, and driving-related functionalities. 

In addition to mobile development, I have backend experience with RESTful APIs using .NET Core and Spring Boot. My master's thesis focused on ‚ÄòcTRUST,‚Äô a novel security mechanism enhancing secure communication between mobile applications and API services.

I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoy solving complex problems, and am committed to continuous learning and delivering innovative, sustainable, user-centric solutions.
