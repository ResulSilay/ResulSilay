I am a Software Engineer with experience in native mobile application development for both Android and iOS platforms. I have worked on architectural design and development phases in projects with a focus on defense industry, telecommunications, education, artificial intelligence, and image processing, serving millions of users. I have also been involved in personal and freelance projects.

Below, you can find more details about specific skills and experiences:

- I have worked on projects with high user interaction, including personal projects published on Google Play and the App Store.
- In Android development, I have experience with Kotlin, Java, Jetpack, and Jetpack Compose, and I have worked with software design patterns such as MVVM, MVI, and MVP.
- For iOS development, I have experience with Swift and SwiftUI, and I have worked with software design patterns including VIPER, MVC, and MVVM.
- I have worked on a Mobile Device Management (MDM) project using Android DevicePolicyAPI.
In the Back-End, I have experience with RESTful API services, .NET CORE, and Spring Boot.
- I completed my undergraduate thesis on 'Modeling the Environmental Effects of Explosives in a Simulation Environment' using .NET WPF technology for simulation.

In software and design projects, I prioritize developing high-quality software with a focus on SOLID principles, software architectures, clean code, project continuity, testability, stability, and user experience.
